/**
 * # Alien Sentinel
 *
 * A slightly more durable but less mobile xeno caste.  Utilizes neurotoxin to bring down prey, and has a unique cloaking ability.
 *
 * A caste of alien which prefers to act more at a range and with stealth compared to the hunter.  While it is slower than
 * the average human, its neurotoxin spit allows to to stun a target from afar so it can close the distance and capture prey.
 * To assist with this, the sentinel also has the unique ability to become barely visible, allowing it to ambush targets and
 * evade pursuers, especially in the dark or when standing on resin.
