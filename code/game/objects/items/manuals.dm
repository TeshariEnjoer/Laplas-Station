				<h3>Growing Humans</h3>

				Why would you want to grow humans? Well I'm expecting most readers to be in the slave trade, but a few might actually
				want to revive fallen comrades. Growing pod people is easy, but prone to disaster.
				<p>
				<ol>
				<li>Find a dead person who is in need of cloning. </li>
				<li>Take a blood sample with a syringe. </li>
				<li>Inject a seed pack with the blood sample. </li>
				<li>Plant the seeds. </li>
				<li>Tend to the plants water and nutrition levels until it is time to harvest the cloned human.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
				It really is that easy! Good luck!

				<h1>Food for Dummies</h1>
				Here is a guide on basic food recipes and also how to not poison your customers accidentally.


				<h2>Basic ingredients preparation:</h2>

				<b>Dough:</b> 10u water + 15u flour for simple dough.<br>
				15u egg yolk + 15u flour + 5u sugar for cake batter.<br>
				Doughs can be transformed by using a knife and rolling pin.<br>
				All doughs can be microwaved.<br>
				<b>Bowl:</b> Add water to it for soup preparation.<br>
				<b>Meat:</b> Microwave it, process it, slice it into microwavable cutlets with your knife, or use it raw.<br>
				<b>Cheese:</b> Add 5u universal enzyme (catalyst) to milk and soy milk to prepare cheese (sliceable) and tofu.<br>
				<b>Rice:</b> Mix 10u rice with 10u water in a bowl then microwave it.

				<h2>Custom food:</h2>
				Add ingredients to a base item to prepare a custom meal.<br>
				The bases are:<br>
				- bun (burger)<br>
				- breadslices(sandwich)<br>
				- plain bread<br>
				- plain pie<br>
				- vanilla cake<br>
				- empty bowl (salad)<br>
				- bowl with 10u water (soup)<br>
				- boiled spaghetti<br>
				- pizza bread<br>
				- metal rod (kebab)

				<h2>Table Craft:</h2>
				Put ingredients on table, then click and drag the table onto yourself to see what recipes you can prepare.

				<h2>Microwave:</h2>
				Use it to cook or boil food ingredients (meats, doughs, egg, spaghetti, donkpocket, etc...).
				It can cook multiple items at once.

				<h2>Processor:</h2>
				Use it to process certain ingredients (meat into meatballs, doughslice into spaghetti, potato into fries,etc...)

				<h2>Gibber:</h2>
				Stuff an animal in it to grind it into meat.

				<h2>Meat spike:</h2>

			Nuclear Explosives 101:<br>
			Hello and thank you for choosing the Syndicate for your nuclear information needs.<br>
			Today's crash course will deal with the operation of a Fusion Class Nanotrasen made Nuclear Device.<br>
			First and foremost, DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING UNTIL THE BOMB IS IN PLACE.<br>
			Pressing any button on the compacted bomb will cause it to extend and bolt itself into place.<br>
			If this is done to unbolt it one must completely log in which at this time may not be possible.<br>
			To make the nuclear device functional:<br>
			<li>Place the nuclear device in the designated detonation zone.</li>
			<li>Extend and anchor the nuclear device from its interface.</li>
			<li>Insert the nuclear authorisation disk into slot.</li>
			<li>Type numeric authorisation code into the keypad. This should have been provided. Note: If you make a mistake press R to reset the device.
			<li>Press the E button to log onto the device.</li>
			You now have activated the device. To deactivate the buttons at anytime for example when you've already prepped the bomb for detonation	remove the auth disk OR press the R on the keypad.<br>
			Now the bomb CAN ONLY be detonated using the timer. Manual detonation is not an option.<br>
			Note: Nanotrasen is a pain in the neck.<br>
			Toggle off the SAFETY.<br>
			Note: You wouldn't believe how many Syndicate Operatives with doctorates have forgotten this step.<br>
			So use the - - and + + to set a det time between 5 seconds and 10 minutes.<br>
			Then press the timer toggle button to start the countdown.<br>
			Now remove the auth. disk so that the buttons deactivate.<br>
			Note: THE BOMB IS STILL SET AND WILL DETONATE<br>
			Now before you remove the disk if you need to move the bomb you can:<br>
			Toggle off the anchor, move it, and re-anchor.<br><br>
			Good luck. Remember the order:<br>
			<b>Disk, Code, Safety, Timer, Disk, RUN!</b><br>
			Intelligence Analysts believe that normal Nanotrasen procedure is for the Captain to secure the nuclear authorisation disk.<br>
			Good luck!

			<h1>Trickwines for brewers</h1>
			Okay, so you just joined the SRM and you want to make some brews! I'm tired of explaining all of this so I'm jotting it all down for the new hires.<br>
			Trickwines almost all share the same effect. When you drink them, they provide a beneficial effect and when you toss them at someone it provides some sort of bad effect.
			<h2> Breakaway flasks</h2>
			Honestly, I love these things. I'm not a scientist so I cant exactly explain how it works but somehow when you fuse plasma into glass it makes it ultra sharp and makes it really good for cracking over fauna heads.<br>
			The simplest way I have found of making them is crafting them with a chunk of glass, plasma, and a welder.<br>

			<h2> Bacteria </h2>
			A speical speices of bacteria native to Illestren is what allows Trickwines form.<br>
			Now we use a special distiller that keeps just enough bacertia alive to ferment without turning the batch sour.<br>
			Now you should still have one on board but if you dont its fine.<br>
			It just so happens we have trees on board our ships host to the Bacteria.<br>
			To get enough Bacteria your going to need to feed it anything that would help a plant.<br>
			Water, Fertilizer, Ashwine are all good options.<br>
			Soon it will drops some apples and you can grind them for the bacteria.<br>
			Once you have enough you can fabricate it the same way you would a normal barrel.<br>

			<h2> Ratios </h2>
			A common trend among Trickwines is the ratio of 3:1:1.<br>
			3 parts being an ethonal, the other 2 parts are often made from flora or fauna.<br>

			<h2> Ashwine </h2>
			It's kind of our trademark, and it's one of the simplest trickwines to make.<br>
			These are the most common wines used in ceremonies so we often stock ships with the moonflowers needed to make them.<br>
			It's made with a ratio of 3:1:1 absinthe, mushroom hallucinogen, and ash respectively.<br>
			Mushroom hallucinogens come from mushroom caps and you can ferment absinthe from moonflowers.<br>
			Its a mild hallucinogenic but seems to have powerful cleansing effects on the devoted SRM.<br>
			It can also really fuck someone up, causing their vision to go shaky and blurry which makes it difficult for them to fight.<br>

			<h2> Icewine </h2>
			This one helps stopping foes in their tracks. One of my favorite flavor wise.
			Its made with 3:1:1 saké, polar bear fur, frost oil(grind chilled peppers).<br>
			You can get polar bear fur and frost oil from grinding up polar bear hides and chilled peppers.<br>
			It's pretty good at sealing burns and lowering your temperature quickly.<br>
			However, it completely encases foes in ice and drops their temperature substantially.<br>

			<h2> Shockwine </h2>
			Easily my favorite for its splashed effect, this thing is great at scorching most fauna.<br>
			Its made with vodka, calcium, and lemon juice.<br>
			If you did not know, vodka requires enzymes instead of the normal fermenting process.<br>
			It's a nice upper. Great if you're trying to run away.<br>
			This one's really flashy. Expect some severe burns on your target<br>

			<h2> Hearthwine </h2>
			I once threw back a flask of this stuff in the heat of a really bad battle and it sealed my wounds within seconds its honestly increadible.<br>
			It also acts like the inverse of Icewine heating you up more then a fever.<br>
			Last time I threw it at someone though i almost burnt down the forest I was in.<br>
			Its made out of ground up fireblossems with some nice hard cider and a bit of welding fuel with of course a ratio of 3:1:1.<br>

			<h2> Forcewine </h2>
			Two intresting effects from the consumption of Forcewine.<br>
			First it seems to give you an "anti magic" effect, I have read about of tales of how it fizzled out some sort of great curse that we could best trace back to a ancient cult.<br>
			Second is it protects the mind from cohersion and mind control.<br>
			From my research this seems to act like nanotrasen mindshield implants.<br>
			Would recomend for any esoteric senarios. We wont see these alot but its always smart to prepare for the worst.<br>
			You can also use it to entrap Fauna inside of a forcefield like bubble, Gives you time to breath and prepare an attack.<br>
			3:1:1. Tequila, Space Montain Wind, and I know its one of the most difficult things to come by but hollow water, Its that stuff you can extract from geysers<br>

			<h2> Prismwine </h2>
			Gives you a nice shiny layer of armour, fire seems to have alot harder time sticking to me when i tested it.<br>
			Throwing it seeems to do the reverse acting like a magnifying glass to burns and lasers<br>
			3:1:1. Good ol Gin, then add plasma and tinea luxor which is found from mushroom stems<br>

			Some of these can be a bit situatinal but its always nice to have a few in your bag for emergecys.<br>
			As a bonus, most of the other factions have no clue how to make these so you can sell them for a fair chunk of cash.<br>
