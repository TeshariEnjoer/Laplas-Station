      their wings aren't already burnt off.

      stamping on the saboteur's hand
  SteelSlayer:
  - code_imp: Updates various machines, which currently use SSfastprocess, so that
      they only start processing when it's necessary. Some of these updated machines
      have been changed so that they don't ever need to process.
  - refactor: Replaces the speed_process var with two new variables. The processing_flags
      variable stores bitflags with information about a machine's preferences on when
      it should start processing. The subsystem_type var holds the path to which type
      of subsystem that machine should use.
  Time-Green:
  - bugfix: Plumbing stuff shouldnt have misleading directions and CONSTANTLY SPIN
      EVERYWHERE

      to cure.

      and spawnergrenade
  trollbreeder:
  - rscadd: Nanotrasen has asked to return all first-aid kits produced before 2559
      as they've been recalled due to potential risk of lead acetate poisoning.
  - rscadd: Medical doctors have been seen emotionally attached to these outdated
      first-aid kits.
  - rscdel: Nanotrasen reports fewer cases of necrophillia, as medical doctors no
      longer feel any emotions towards body bags.
  - rscdel: Nanotrasen also reports that medical doctors are no longer attached to
      21st century heart listening devices.
  - imageadd: Ancient medkits are now properly ancient in design.

2020-04-04:
  ArcaneMusic:
  - bugfix: The entirety of hydroponics works again!
  - rscadd: Plants can now Cross-Pollinate, via adjacency. This causes plant stats
      of average into each-other.
  - rscadd: Plants now have a new stat, Instability. Instability allows for gradual
      mutations to a plant's stats at certain thresholds, and a chance of mutation,
      or gaining new random traits at even higher thresholds.
  - rscadd: Plants can be grafted when ready to harvest, and grafts can be applied
      to plants in order to share unique traits, or share stat changes.
  - rscdel: The Plant DNA Manipulator is dead. Long Live the DNA manipulator.
  - tweak: Hydroponics trays now have their own internal beaker for holding chemical
      reagents. As such, chemical affects on plants are gradual, and slowly alter
      seed stats over generations.
  - balance: Several chemicals are adjusted to match the new system. Experiment!
  EOBGames (Inept):
  - rscadd: A whole bunch of materials are now datumised! Check out bronze, runed
      metal, sand, sandstone, snow, paper, cardboard, bone and bamboo. Oh, and pizza.
      Yes, pizza.
  Ryll/Shaps:
  - rscadd: Adds stingbangs to cargo (and one in the sec vendor premium), premium
      less-lethal grenades that shoot off a giant swarm of stingball pellets to help
      incapacitate swarms of people in tight quarters. You can jump on top of a live
      one to be a hero and absorb a bunch of shrapnel, same with  frag grenades. There's
      even an achievement for dying to a grenade you jumped on!
  - rscadd: Projectiles can now embed in people! Or at least grenade shrapnel and
      the new .38 DumDum ammo, now available in cargo, can. DumDum rounds excel against
      unarmored targets, but are pricey and do poorly against armored targets.
  - rscadd: Bullets can now ricochet! Or at least, standard .38 and the new .38/L6
      Match Grade ammo can. Match Grade ammo is finely tuned to ricochet easier and
      seek targets off bounces better, and can be purchased from cargo (for the .38)
      or nuke ops uplink (for the L6), but standard .38 ammo has a chance to ricochet
      as well.
  - tweak: Frag grenades now have smaller explosions but shoot off a bunch of devastating
      shrapnel, excellent for soft targets!
  - tweak: Shotguns and other multi-pellet guns now print aggregate messages, so you'll
      get one "You've been hit by 6 buckshot pellets!" rather than 6 "You've been
      hit by the buckshot pellet in the X!" messages. Bye bye lag!
  - balance: Armor can now protect against embedding weapons, taking the best of either
      the bullet or bomb armor for the limb in question away from the embed chance.
      Some weapons are better at piercing armor than others!
  - rscadd: Due to pressure from various organizations, Nanotrasen is implementing
      a new ban on the purchase of alcohol and tobacco products for crewmembers under
      the age of 20 onboard its Spinward space stations. Please remember that providing
      alcohol or tobacco products to underage crewmembers is against Space Law, and
      remember to check those cards bartenders!
  - rscadd: Standard Nanotrasen IDs now display the registered age of the holder,
      which you can change at the HoP's access console.

  Ghilker:
  - bugfix: Hot ice burn in fires (made a change to obj_defense.dm where in the obj/fire_act
      proc i added at the end of the proc . = ..(), allowing it to call for the parent,
      i initially put it at the start obj/fire_act proc but it caused hot ice to runtime
      when burned. This change will affect everything that uses fire_act and fire_react
      procs)
  - rscdel: Removed hot ice ability to make furnitures (to do this i had to add a
      new flag to all the base mats that had the MAT_CATEGORY_RIGID flag, the new
      flag is MAT_CATEGORY_BASE_RECIPES, if this flag is true then the four basic
      recipes will appear, otherwhise it wont)

  - tweak: changed the beauty value of the hot ice basemat from 0.75 to 0.2
