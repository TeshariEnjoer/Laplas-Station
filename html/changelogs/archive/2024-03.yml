      screwdriver, hand, multitool, wrench, crowbar/wrench/hand (so you can flavor
      how you remove the limb)'
  - tweak: 'changes the Prosthetic Replacement surgery, renaming it to Limb Grafting
      surgery. The steps remain the same, but the name needed some retooling, as the
      procedure is much more surgically involved than its new sibling:'

      of the Limb Grafting surgery. This allows for people with prostheses to re-attach
