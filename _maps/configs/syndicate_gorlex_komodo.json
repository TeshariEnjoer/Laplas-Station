	"description": "An ICW-era design, the Komodo is a dedicated warship operated by the Gorlex Marauders. Contemporaries of the legendary Starfury-class, Komodos were the backbone of Gorlex and ACLF fleets during the ICW, and saw significant combat service â€“ not always to a tragic end like their Cybersun companions. Contemporary examples often still bear the scars of ICW-period combat, and the dire financial straits of most Gorlex splinter factions means many of those survivors are in a state of poor repair. Despite the stresses of age, they remain capable ships, and often still have the heavier armament associated with their ICW deployments in storage.",
