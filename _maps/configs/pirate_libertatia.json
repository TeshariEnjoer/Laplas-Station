	"description": "A widely-available and dirt-cheap courier ship by Miskilamo Spacefaring, Libertatias are shoddy overhauls of old civilian atmospheric ships or the burned-out wrecks of other Libertatias, made nominally space worthy and capable of carrying a modest cargo at blistering speeds. While marketed as courier ships and short-range cargo shuttles, the Libertatia found its true target market in the hands of smugglers, blockade runners, and pirates, who find its speed, low sensor signature, and rock-bottom price point extremely attractive. In recent years, itâ€™s become far more common to see Libertatias captained by pirates than anyone else, especially in the loosely-patrolled Frontier sectors. Surprisingly enough, the more organized Frontiersmen pirate group shows little love for the humble Libertatia, instead preferring larger and more threatening ships.",
